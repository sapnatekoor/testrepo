        NolanAI Film Scheduling is a powerful feature that uses advanced algorithms and the power of AI to
         automatically sort your strawboard in the most efficient way for shooting. It also provides you with
          an approximate shooting duration per scene, which can be configured based on the number of 
          cameras, takes, and complexity factors such as action sequences, costumes, and stunts.
